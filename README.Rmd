*cry* is an R package to make it easier dealing with crystallographic data. The package includes functions to read/write
data from/to some of the file mostly used in software for
structural crystallography. Current entry include the `readMTZ` function
to read MTZ files (see [CCP4](https://www.ccp4.ac.uk)) and the
corresponding `writeMTZ`. There are also `readCIF`, `readpd_rtv` and `readSF_CIF` to read files in CIF formats (Crystallographic Information Framework, see [IUCr page](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries)). Users are welcome to suggest inclusions of different (not currently available) formats they might need for specific tasks and/or analysis.

*cry* includes also several functions to perform the most common
and routine crystallographic calculations, many of them involving
crystallographic symmetry. The main purpose of these functions
is to enable users to investigate specific issues without having to
resort to external packages and thus carrying the analysis through
without having to abandon the R platform.

## Installation

You can install the released version of crone from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cry")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jfoadi/cry")
```
## Example

This is a simple example in which a CIF file containing structure factors is read and a part of its data used for statistical analysis. The file is included as example file in *cry* and is called *1dei-sf.cif*. The first
task is to import the data in R.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Load cry package
library(cry)

# Save CIF data in a named list
datadir <- system.file("extdata",package="cry")
filename <- file.path(datadir,"1dei-sf.cif")
lCIF <- readSF_CIF(filename)
```

The newly-created R object, a list called `lCIF`, contains all that
is included in the CIF file, but within a structure that can be
used within R for various analyses. The components of this list can
be readily explored using the common R functions `names`, `class`
and `str`.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# What's containe in lCIF?
names(lCIF)

# What's the header?
class(lCIF$HEADER)   # It's a list

# Is it a named list?
names(lCIF$HEADER)  # Yes

# What's the space group name for this crystal structure?
print(lCIF$HEADER$HM)

# What's the space group number corresponding to P 21 21 21?
# Use one of cry's functions
xHM <- lCIF$HEADER$HM
translate_SG(xHM,SG_in="xHM",SG_out="number")$msg

# ... and the unit cell parameters?
cpars <- c(lCIF$HEADER$CELL$A$VAL,lCIF$HEADER$CELL$B$VAL,
           lCIF$HEADER$CELL$C$VAL,lCIF$HEADER$CELL$ALPHA$VAL,
           lCIF$HEADER$CELL$BETA$VAL,lCIF$HEADER$CELL$GAMMA$VAL)
print(cpars)

# The unit cell belongs to the orthorombic system,
# as it should be, due to symmetry (cry function)
print(crystal_system(gn=19))
```

The most important bit in the CIF file are the observed reflections (coming from x-ray diffraction of one or more crystals). They are contained in the named list `REFL`. All
CIF files have a `VAL` field reporting the specific observed
quantity and a field `STD` reporting the corresponding experimental error. Not always the last one is available. The
`VAL` field is an R data frame that makes these data suitable to
further analysis within R. The `STD` field mirrors `VAL`, but with
the experimental errors counterparts, if available, otherwise it
is `NULL`, as in the case here reported.
